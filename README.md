# G.O.A.T.-Stilts-
 ## Gravity Offset and Training Stilts 
 #### *Temple University Senior Design Team A06: Randy Bocan, Athena Chan, Sagar Desai, Zachary Hagenberg, Dan Souder, Bryan Trinh*


### *Introduction*

  **Objective**: To simulate the biomechanics of locomotion in a low gravity environment. Affordability and versability are top priorities.Â 
        
   **Historical Solutions**: Past solutions fall short on training time, environmental adjustability, and cost.
        
   **Our Solution**: Using the Walking Froude Number theory, we can mimic gait characteristics under different gravities by changing the length of the swinging limb.
        
  **Ethics and Sustainability**: Reusable design, easily accessible, aid in further pursuit of science

### *My Section of the Stilt Design*

Working with the Mechanical Engineers in the Team, we had designed the Ankle Joint of the stilts to be pivoting off an axis to mimic flexion and extension of a human ankle. It was a modified SACH Ankle (Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel) to ensure the stilts had resembled Human Gait. There was a spring assembly embedded in the Heel to have a similar cushioned effect as a nautral chillies tendon.
