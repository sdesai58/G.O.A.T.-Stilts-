### *Introduction*

The Project I have outline below was our Senior Design Project while at Temple University. We were tasked with designing a method for astronauts to mimic martian gravity for training purposes. Using the Froude Principle, we were able to mathematically able to relate the length of the swinging limb to a proportion of gravity. In theory, increasing the swinging limb length, would decrease the effect of gravity while maintaining constant flow velocity. 

### *My Section of the Stilt Design*

Working with the Mechanical Engineers in the Team, we had designed the Ankle Joint of the stilts to be pivoting off an axis to mimic flexion and extension of a human ankle. It was a modified SACH Ankle (Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel) to ensure the stilts had resembled Human Gait. There was a spring assembly embedded in the Heel to have a similar cushioned effect as a nautral chillies tendon.

With this project being done during the COVID 19 Pandemic, We had designed it virtually as a group using a group members work station. I was in charge of the ankle design and my friends Dan, Athena and I  had translated this into CAD using Solidworks. Throughout the design process, it had began as a sketch and then further refined in Solidworks. I was in charge of the core ankle joint and the spring assembly for gait functionality. 

It was designed and machined out of Aluminum 6061 for affordability and durability while maintaining a lighter weight per stilt.

Bryan was successfully able to complete trials and walk with a similar method as Human gait, with an emphasis upon the heel to toe stride. However, we were not comfortable walking on the stilts for extended periods of time due to safety and inexperience upon stilts.  There were no accidents during any of the testing and trials!
